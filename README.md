# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code

Began by planning out pseudo code in script file and looking over the module assingment criteria.

Then I added the basic timeblocks in the html in order to get an outline of the day with hours listed. 
After the setup of the timeblocks, I added classes by looking at css file and using context clues to find correct classes. 
Then I played with the 9am timeblock with bootstrap and figured out the basic setup and added the same to the other timeblocks.

I could not help myself and had to get the time to show up on top to get started with the javascript. Turns out I was using the wrong path to my js file in my html document so it took me a while to figure it out. I used the devtools and also realized my css file was also linked incorrectly.
